# hackmatch

Our team's project for YHack 2015.
Match hackers before the hackathon based on their intention and skil.

####How we came up with this idea:

We found each other on Facebook page, but it is very inefficient. 
Most importantly, its a disaster when a hacker that just wants to hang out get teamed up with a hacker that is all in to win a prize. 

####What our app does:

Our app's simple algorism (shoutout to Dave) sorts the users based on how they answered the registration questions.
We put the most weight on "Why are you attening a hackathon?" questions.
